    <h2>Why Contact Fitbit Customer Support?</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>What Is the Fitbit Customer Support Number?</h2>
    <p>Fitbit’s customer support number varies by region and may not always be directly listed.

    </ol>

    <h2>Alternative: Use Fitbit Live Chat</h2>
    <p>If a phone number isn’t available or if you prefer text-based support, live chat is a quick and effective option.

      <li>Your account login email</li>
      <li>Proof of purchase (if asking for a replacement or refund)</li>
      <li>Details about your issue, including error messages or screenshots</li>
    </ul>
